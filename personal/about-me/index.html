                    I grew up in Ann Arbor, Michigan with two dogs, three cats, and no tv. After I graduated
                    from Community High School (go Rainbow Zebras!) I was financially independent for two years
                    during which I worked in Ann Arbor, then moved to Colorado to play in a band, rock climb,
                    and ski while working as a janitor at Whole Foods. I returned to Ann Arbor to start school at
                    the local community college, and transferred to the University of Michigan (Ann Arbor) after 
                    three semesters. I floated between many majors at U of M, finally settling in Computer Science
                    and Engineering. My time there was defined by some amazing professors, teaching EECS 281, working
                    at Michigan Aerospace Corporation, and
                    meeting some great friends. I worked at Microsoft my "junior" Summer (I ended up taking five years,
                    so it was actually my senior Summer) and realized that I didn't want to work in corporate tech.
                    I threw myself into machine learning, statistics, and applied math, which carried me into my
                    Masters program, also at U of M.

                    Between graduating from undergrad and taking classes for my masters program full time, I worked
                    full-time at Michigan Aerospace Corporation (MAC) in Ann Arbor for two years. This was easily my favorite
                    job to date. The staff at MAC felt like a family, and I was working on many different projects that
                    I enjoyed. My mentor at MAC, Dr. Matthew Lewis, is an inspiration and a close friend. I sadly left MAC
                    to finish my graduate degree and do research at the university.

                    In my masters program, I have focused on broadening my skill set from primarily being the software
                    side of machine learning to having a more holistic understanding of the math and statistics. I've had
                    more great professors, and I've been lucky enough to do research with Dr. Fernanda Valdovinos, who
                    is a professor at UC Davis' school of Environmental Science, Economics, and Policy. We are interested
                    in ecological networks, and the dynamics that govern them. I have also been taking some classes on the
                    side of my required classes; the one that I've enjoyed the most is a history class titled "Religion
                    and the Economy before Modernity" with Dr. Hussein Fancy. This class has been an amazing investigation
                    into the foundational beliefs in our economy and our religions.

                    Outside of school and work, I play guitar, cook, ferment things, pickle things, think about stuff,
                    run, travel, mountain bike, drink water, talk about how many more lights I could have where I'm living,
                    wander around my neighborhood, worry about the world and who I am, rock climb sometimes although I think
                    I'm slowly giving it up, hike, think about how old random things are, hang out with my dog, and recently
                    I've been thinking about making a block print cause it looks like fun! I've been thinking about how different
                    religions view each other throughout history, and about how modern society seems to value tangibility over
                    intangibility, creation over experience, and rationality over irrationality. Not sure where that's going.
                    My favorite book that I've read recently is Infinite Jest, definitely a book that any modern human can 
                    and should read. Anyways, hit me up if you want to talk!
