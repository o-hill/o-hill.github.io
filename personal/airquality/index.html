                    In my senior year of college, I studied air quality modeling with Dr. Sofia Piltz.
                    This was done through a physics-based approach, as well as a statistical modeling 
                    approach. In this project I learned a lot about modeling with differential equations,
                    and the difficulty of modeling complex natural processes. Even attempting to predict the
                    air  quality three days from now is quite difficult.

                    Using a conglomeration of many NOAA datasets, I've taken this project a bit farther myself.
                    The process of acquiring and cleaning the NOAA data was unlike anything I've  experienced before.
                    There seems to be no process or standards for the data, and many of the datasets have little to
                    no desciption of the data in the data files, the only  description existing in natural
                    language on a page that links to the data, but is not linked from the data. Datasets that 
                    seem like they would be stored together are often stored in different areas, with datasets from
                    completely separate projects. All of this makes it very difficult, if not impossible, to programmatically
                    scrape data. Nevertheless, I succeeded in acquiring many of these datasets and compiling them
                    into a large datasete that I could use to test and validate models.

                    I spent quite a bit of time refining the differential equations models, and had some success there. The
                    tough part of this project is that there is a large and very important term that is difficult to
                    find, or even collect, data on. This term is known in the literature as "sources and sinks" and
                    is used to describe all of the factors that produce particulate emissions, as well as those that
                    sequester them. This means tracking highway and city traffic, factory emissions, and agricultural
                    emissions to name a few of the larger factors. It also means understanding the carbon sequestration
                    in the surrounding area and chemical scrubbing occurring in the atmosphere. All of this adds up
                    to an incredibly complex and important term that is very difficult to find data on. The conclusion I came to
                    was that without a large amount of time, or a better dataset, I was going to havee trouble getting
                    farther in this project.
